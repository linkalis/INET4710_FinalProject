    "Fortunately, a group of researchers at the EPA has an interesting finding when conducting a similar image classification task, also on NAIP imagery.  They make an important observation that seemed relevant to helping improve the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"Shadows cast by vegetation and structures add significant noise to imagery at one meter resolution. Shadows typically appear at the edges of tall buildings and trees, and mottled within tree canopies, and are commonly misclassified as water or impervious surface. Using a binary step of classifying vegetation versus non-vegetation reduced these errors.\" (See: [Baynes, et al.](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/baynes_esri_landcover_120313.pdf))\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, I heavily adapted the model to the final version you see below.  Because the training and test fit process share so many similar steps, the `fit_ndvi_segmented_nmf()` function below can actually perform _both_ the training and test fits, based on user inputs.  The function takes the following arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `model_name`: used as the beginning of the filename when saving the model to disk (recommended to use a name that acts as a reminder of which image the model was trained on)\n",
    "- `img_df_long`: raster image data, coerced to a list format using `make_img_long()` function defined above\n",
    "- `img_metadata`: raster image metadata, extracted from the `make_img_long()` function above, and used to coerce the data back into its original image dimensions\n",
    "- `mode`: whether to train a new model (\"train\"), or load existing models from disk and fit to new image data (\"test\")\n",
    "- `ndvi_water_cutoff`: determine which cutoff to use for classifying pixels as water; any pixels with NDVI values below this cutoff will be automatically classified as water\n",
    "- `ndvi_pos_components`: how many land use classes to extract in the NDVI positive range (generally corresponding to vegetation)\n",
    "- `ndvi_neg_components`: how many land use classes to extract in the NDVI negative range (generally corresponding to urban/built environments)\n",
    "- `save_to_file` & `filename`: whether to save the resulting classified raster to disk, and which filename to use\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling proceeds as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Segment the image data into three classes based on the pixels' NDVI values: 1) pixels that likely represent water; 2) pixels with positive NDVI values; 3) pixels with negative NDVI values that are greater than the cutoff value used for water\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Train two separate models--one for pixels with positive NDVI values and one for pixels with negative NDVI values.  The user can specify how many separate land use classes (i.e. NMF components) to extract within each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Save the two models to disk, so they can be used later to classify test images.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For pixels with an NDVI value that is lower than the ndvi_water_cutoff threshold, simply classify these as 'water' with no additional modeling effort required.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For all other pixels, use the pixel weights extracted from the models to determine which class/component each pixel is most likely to belong to. This is accomplished with a simple call to `argmax` for each row in the weights matrices that are yielded from each model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Coerce the input image list back into its original height and width dimensions.  Save the resulting raster to disk so it can be visualized in a GIS tool, if desired. "

    "Let's first examine the model with 3 positive/3 negative classes.  Starting with the positive components first, it looks like the first two positive components are somewhat similar: they both are weighted strongly in the red, green, and blue spectral bands.  The main difference is that the second positive component weights very low on the near-infrared band.  Interestingly, the latter appears to be a characteristic of artificial turf, suggesting this class likely corresponds to artifical turf (see: [Lillesand & Kiefer, 1979, p. 76](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19810004007.pdf)).  The third positive component is weighted strongly in the green and blue spectral bands, but has little to no red--a phenomenon which appears to be characteristic of tree cover (see: Lillesand & Kiefer, 1979, p. 15).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examining the negative components, we see that the first class is weighted similarly on the red, green, blue, and infrared bands.  The existence of all three visible bands suggests this is associated with material that is dark, and the presence of strong weight in the infrared band suggests this material may also contain some vegetation, which means this is likely to represent soil or clay.  The second negative component still weights strongly in red, green, and blue, but its infrared weight is quite low, suggesting that pixels with this classification are unlikely to have any vegetative matter.  This could represent asphalt, paved roads, and buildings.  The final class is a bit of a puzzle: it has virtually no blue, but weighs relatively strongly in the infrared band.  What this means is a little unclear, but it seems possible this could represent material that is lighter in color, and that may contain some vegetation.  This could be something like sand, which seems like it should be similar to dirt (the first class) in its infrared weight, but lighter in color and hence weighing less in the blue spectrum."

    "Let's next examine the model with 5 positive/5 negative classes.  Looking at the positive components, we see similar patterns as the first model: the first positive class in the chart seems likely to represent grass, the second positive class seems likely to represent artificial turf, or possibly dead grass that is losing reflectance in the infrared spectrum and gaining in the red spectrum.  The third and forth classes are interesting, as they both have little or no weight in the red spectrum, but vary starkly in their infrared weight.  The lack of red in both of these classes suggests tree cover; indeed, if we examine Lillesand and Kiefer's discussion of the spectral reflecance of tree cover (p. 15), we notice that deciduous and coniferous trees both reflect very little in the red range, but can vary in their infrared reflectance.  This suggests that the third class is likely to represent deciduous trees, which reflect strongly in the infrared spectrum, and the fourth class could be coniferous trees, which are weaker in infrared reflectance.  The final class is more ambiguous, but seems like it should represent something relatively light in color (due to the lack of blue) and vegetative; this could be something like algae or vegetative swampland.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the negative classes, we again see that the first class in the chart is likely to be dirt or clay, as its signature is very simlar to the first negative component in the previous model.  The second class again seems likely to be asphalt or buildings, due to its lack of reflectance in the infrared band.  The third class is more confusing: it contains only green and blue reflectance in the visible specture, but has high weight in the infrared band.  This could be darker soil of some sort.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The final two classes are more confusing.  By \"cheating\" a bit and looking at the classified image in a GIS program, we can tell that the fourth class appears to be associated with shade, and often shaded asphalt.  This is not a particularly useful classification, and seems to have only emerged because, by adding additional components during training, we have allowed the model to overfit to some of the noise in the data.  In the simpler, 3-class model, this shade classification does not emerge, and pixels appear to be classified with the asphalt/buildings class, where they _actually_ below.  The fifth and final class, when viewed in a GIS program, makes it look like this is a class that focuses on red objects (ex: red roof, running tracks, etc.).  It is possible this class emerged during training thanks to the existence of a number of buildings on the St. Paul Campus that have distinctively red roofs--enough to make the model sit up and pay attention!  A class category like this could be useful in cities where roofs often tend to be make of red clay or similar materials, but it is a bit too specific to be useful in a broader-purpose model."
